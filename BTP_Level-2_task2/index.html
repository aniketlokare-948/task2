            Dennis M. Ritchie, (born September 9, 1941, Bronxville, Eastchester, New York, U.S.—found dead October 2011, Berkeley 
            Heights, New Jersey), American computer scientist and cowinner of the 1983 A.M. Turing Award, the highest honour in 
            computer science. Ritchie and the American computer scientist Kenneth L. Thompson were cited jointly for “their development 
            of generic soperating systems theory and specifically for the implementation of the UNIX operating system,” which they developed 
            together at Bell Laboratories.Ritchie earned a bachelors degree (1963) in physics and a doctorate (1968) in mathematics from 
            Harvard University. In 1967 he joined Bell Labs, where he first worked on the Multics operating system (OS). Multics was a time-sharing system funded by 
            the Advanced Research Projects Agency and jointly developed by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bell Labs, 
            and General Electric Co. However, AT&T Corporation (then the parent company of Bell Labs) withdrew from the project and removed its GE
             computers in 1969.
